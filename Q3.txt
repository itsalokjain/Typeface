To design a datastore for the given scenario, we need to consider the following factors:

1) The number of APIs and the number of users making requests to the service
2) The type of data that needs to be stored.
3) The queries that will be performed on the datastore

ServiceMonitoringData

- name (string): name of the API.
- userid (integer): ID of the user making the request.
- requestTime (datetime): timestamp of the request.
- responseTime (integer): response time of the request in milliseconds.
- errorStatus (boolean): whether the request resulted in an error.


Part 1
	SELECT name, MAX(AVG(responseTime)) AS avg_response_time
	FROM ServiceMonitoringData
	GROUP BY name
	ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC
	LIMIT 1;


Part 2
	SELECT userid, name, MAX(AVG(response_time)) AS avg_response_time
	FROM ServiceMonitoringData
	GROUP BY userid, apiname
	ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC;

Part 3
	SELECT name, requestTime, SUM(error_status) / COUNT(*) AS error_percentage	
	FROM ServiceMonitoringData
	GROUP BY name, requestTime;
